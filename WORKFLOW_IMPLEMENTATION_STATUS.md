## 🎯 WORKFLOW AUTOMATION IN ACTION

### **Booking Lifecycle Automation:**

#### **1. New Booking Creation:**
```
User fills BookingForm → Validates conflicts → Saves booking with 'Pending' status
```

#### **2. Booking Confirmation:**
```
User clicks "Confirm" → Workflow validates availability → 
Status changes to 'Confirmed' → Database trigger auto-generates invoice →
Notification shows "Booking confirmed successfully" → UI updates
```

#### **3. Booking Completion:**
```
User marks "Completed" → Workflow validates date passed →
Status changes to 'Completed' → Database trigger creates editing job →
Invoice status auto-updates to 'Sent' → Notification shows success
```

#### **4. Automatic Invoice Management:**
```
Booking Confirmed → Auto-creates invoice with calculated pricing →
Payment recorded → Auto-updates invoice status → 
Overdue detection → Daily maintenance marks overdue invoices
```
